## General info
This project is my master thesis. This project presents modification into already existing dynamic frequency algorithm in IEEE 802.11 ac/ax networks which provide optimization in using 5GHz band spectrum and efficiency of relevant devices. I added two modifications:
* Longer time to observe the signal before making a decision

* Additional memory that remembers the moments of the signal appearance to turn off the transmission at these moments

File "Maste_Thesis_fragment.pdf" includes fragment about digital simulation, where are the main simulation assumptions, simulation scenarios, block diagrams, introduced DFS simulation improvements, generated diagrams, and charts (Polish language).
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
