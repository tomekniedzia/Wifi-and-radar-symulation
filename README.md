## General info
This project is my master thesis. This project presents modification into already existing dynamic frequency algorithm in IEEE 802.11 ac/ax networks which provide optimization in using 5GHz band spectrum and efficiency of relevant devices. I added two modyfication:
* Longer time to observe the signal before making a decision

* Additional memory that remembers the moments of the signal appearance in order to turn off the transmission at these moments
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* C++
* MatLab
